# My diary of the github tutorial

I have forgotten everything after two days how I created branches and  so on. But I will solve issue 2 anyway. 
I hope in the second try I complete the task.

## This things I want to know: 
* How can I get the description of issue 1?
* Where is the solution passphrase for issue 2?
* What do I do when I don't find a 3rd item here?
